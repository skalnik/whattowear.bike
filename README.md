# What To Wear

A long time ago, [Bicycling.com][bicycling.com] had a nice guideline
of what amount of clothes you should put on before going on a bike ride.

More recently, [Chris Kelly][ckdake] recreated [this][ck what to wear]. This is
my take on it. Now CK is here to help and his site points people here. Cheers.
